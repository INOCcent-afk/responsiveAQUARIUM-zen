          ‎Aquarium Zen's selection of tropical fish is varied and unique,
          focused on species that do well in freshwater planted aquariums.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our interest is in small, peaceful species that will grace the
          aquarium with gentle, colorful energy. Most of the fish in our store
          have been selected so that they can be freely combined in planted
          community aquariums. The owner of Aquarium Zen, Steve Waldron, has
          over 30 years of aquarium experience and can tell you everything you
          need to know about the fish of your interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          We source many of our fish from local sources and even breed some of
          our own such as rare varieties of livebearers and dwarf shrimp. We can
          also special order just about any type of freshwater fish and have the
          connections to track down rare species.

        Aquatic plants provide the structure and biological support to keep our
        aquarium ecosystems thriving.
      </h1>
      <p>
        Aquarium plants are diverse and beautiful in their own right and we see
        our Nature Aquariums as a style of underwater gardening. There are
        aquatic plants for every type of aquarium and we specialize in helping
        our customers discover the right plant for their aquarium conditions and
        experience level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every aquarium benefits from the addition of living plants and your fish
        will feel more at ease, healthy and contented in a planted aquarium.
        Even if you don't have a green thumb, we can find the right plant for
        you and your aquarium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aquarium Zen carries a wide selection of nursery grown plants and also a
        diverse collection of rarities that we cultivate in the store.

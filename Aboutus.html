          Aquarium Zen is inspired by nature and hopes to share with our
          customers an appreciation for the wonders of life on earth.
        </h1>
        <p>
          A novel way of expressing that love for nature is through an artfully
          designed aquascape. Everything is connected in nature and we see our
          aquascaping business as an opportunity to affect people positively and
          to make the world a better place, even in a small way. If even a small
          portion of our clients leave Aquarium Zen with a better appreciation
          for the interrelationships of plants, fish, aquatic ecosystems and the
          stewardship of nature, we will have done our job.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of our commitment to nature, we choose small, grassroots
          conservation organizations to support both monetarily and with our
          volunteered time. Our current focus is tropical montane cloud forest
          conservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cloud forest environments are magical places filled with
          moss-covered trees, exotic birds, rare amphibians, exuberant
          vegetation and cascading mountain streams – great inspiration for our
          aquarium designs. Through our efforts, we have helped a cloud forest
          reserve in Ecuador gain important publicity and raised funds for
          significant land purchases.

        <h1>
          One of our lifelong dreams was to open a magical aquarium shop that
          would become a destination experience as much as a pet store.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Aquarium Zen is the result of decades of focused aquarium experience,
          passion, and dedication to the art of the Nature Aquarium. Our goal is
          to inspire every person who walks into Aquarium Zen.
        </p>
        <p>
          We realize our customers and community are the most important factor
          in our business' success. To keep high quality customer service
          standards, every customer interaction is handled by Aquarium Zen's
          owner and sole operator, Steve Waldron.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aquarium Zen is the product of Steve's vision to bring an aquarium
          shop focused on the Nature Aquarium style to Seattle. Steve has over
          30 years of aquarium experience and has worked as a professional
          aquarist for nearly twenty years, including the management of
          aquaculture systems for university fish research laboratories as well
          as the retail and wholesale tropical fish trade. Steve has achieved
          the Master Fish Breeder and Master Aquatic Horticulturist status for
          the Greater Seattle Aquarium Society and is a contributing writer for
          the premiere English-language freshwater aquarium magazine, AMAZONAS.
          If you are looking for professional aquarium advice and experienced
          mentorship, Steve is looking forward to becoming your aquarium buddy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are endlessly grateful for this opportunity to celebrate our love
          for naturalistic aquariums with the wonderful community of Seattle and
          all of the Pacific Northwest.

      <h1>
        "One of – if not THE – best places for seeing what can be accomplished
        with an aquarium."
      </h1>
      <p>
        "The perfect blend of modern art masterpieces blended seamlessly with
        the allure of untamed nature. More of a living museum than the
        traditional pet store, this is one of the most impressive businesses
        I've ever had the privilege of visiting. Having traveled from the bayou
        with visiting this shop as the top of my itinerary (aside from work), it
        was a true pleasure. I am most jealous of any locals who are able to
        make regular visits to spruce up their aquaria. With absolutely
        certainty, I will be back and will be filling my bags with goodies to
        take home."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's great to see a store like this. It's a fusion of the 'old school'
        dedication and expertise of the tropical fish hobby combined with a
        stylish new look. Beautiful natural setups with healthy fish & live
        plants. I haven't kept fish in decades but I am re-inspired!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "A different experience than any other fish store in Seattle. Aquarium
        Zen is more like a well kept public aquarium or an art gallery than a
        pet shop. Steve knows his stuff, and only keeps the most interesting
        fish and plants."
      </p>
      <p>"Best aquatic plant store I've been to."</p>
      <p>
        "Absolutely wonderful shop. The owner is skilled and knowledgeable and
        most of all willing to help a newbie like myself to the planted tank
        hobby. He spent a good amount of time giving me suggestions and ways
        that I could get results without going for the most expensive thing. His
        tanks look better than anything I've seen at an aquarium. A must see
        shop!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wonderful place. The aquariums are beautiful...all hand-created with
        natural plants. Steven is terrific, helped my children and me select
        everything, taught us how to set things up and gave us his card in case
        we had problems. I thought the pricing was very reasonable and the
        result is beautiful. I'm now going to buy another one for my office,
        too. I never expected to do that! Steve is an artist – you can tell he
        loves what he's doing, and he's doing it for the right reasons. You've
        got to support that!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Steve was so patient and helpful. His shop is a wonderland. He was
        straightforward and encouraging. I'm telling everyone I know about this
        shop."
      </p>
      <p>
        “I had a ton of questions which Steve was happy to answer and he didn't
        make me feel rushed. The selection of fish, plants, and substrates are
        great! I was a loyal customer to [another Seattle area LFS] but I found
        a new wonderful place that I feel confident will provide me the best
        customer service and products. I will continue to take the
        hour-and-a-half drive here since its worth it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        "The owner is very helpful, knowledgeable and easy to talk to. Amazing
        to find such excellent customer service nowadays! So, appreciate his
        experience that is shared. No weird upsale tactics. Healthy quality fish
        and plants. Reasonable prices too. Great experience all around. Thanks!
        What more can you ask for?”
      </p>
      <p>
        "So glad I found this place as I am new to planted tanks. The owner is
        skilled, knowledgable, friendly and extremely helpful. He didn't try to
        sell my anything that might have been out of my skill level and advised
        me on CO2 strategies I might use. It is a pleasure walking around the
        shop – it looks better than most zoo setups!"
